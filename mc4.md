# Mini challenge 4

 

Update PostListView so that it only shows `Post` entries that are set to `published`.

 

### Steps

1. Update the PostListView class to override the default get_context_object method.

2. Add any necessary filters to ensure that only published posts are visible on the page.

3. Ensure that posts appear in descending order on the page.

### Note

It is recommended to base ourselves off of the get_context_data method in `DraftPostListView`.

# PasswordResetView
This view allows us to enter an email address and receive an email
with instructions on resetting our password (if the email is valid).
```
template_name = "registration/password_reset_form.html"
subject_template_name = "registration/password_reset_subject.txt"
email_template_name = "registration/password_reset_email.html"
```

# PasswordResetDoneView
This view is simply a (text) confirmation communicating that
we submitted the previous form successfully.
```
template_name = "registration/password_reset_done.html"
```

# PasswordResetConfirmView
This view is where we will pick a new password (and confirm it).
```
template_name = "registration/password_reset_confirm.html"
```

# PasswordCompleteView
This view offers a plain text confirmation that we submitted the previous form correctly.
```
template_name = "registration/password_reset_complete.html"
```
